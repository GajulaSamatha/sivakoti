# Shivakoti Temple Management System  

This is a **real-world project** I am currently developing in **Laravel (PHP framework)**.  
The client specifically requested Laravel, which challenged me to learn and build in this framework while simultaneously delivering the project.  

## Project Overview  
The application is designed for **temple management** with three distinct roles:  

- **Super Admin** – Full control over all modules (manage admins, roles, permissions, events, devotees).  
- **Admin** – Manage devotees, puja bookings, events, and day-to-day operations.  
- **Devotee** – Register, log in, book pujas/darshan, and access temple-related services.  

Each role has its own **actions, permissions, and flows**, making the project complex and interesting.  

## My Journey  
- While I already had **PHP knowledge**, I was new to **Laravel**. I started learning Laravel in parallel while building this project.  
- This project has given me exposure to **role-based access control, database design, and complex workflow handling**.  
- Despite a tight timeline, I’m committed to delivering a solution that meets the client’s expectations.  

## Current Responsibilities  
- Learning Laravel fundamentals while applying them directly in this project.  
- Implementing **multi-role authentication and authorization**.  
- Designing intuitive UIs for devotees and admins.  
- Ensuring scalability and maintainability for real-world use.  

## Other Commitments (Parallel Work)  
Alongside Shivakoti, I am:  
- Serving as **GR (Group Representative)** of my class.  
- Participating in **MSME Hackathon** and **Amaravati Quantum Valley Hackathon (AQVH)**.  
- Working on a **CSP project** under the guidance of the JNTUA Principal, which is expected to evolve into a commercial application.  
- Preparing for **semester exams**.  

## Reflection  
I believe getting opportunities to work on **real-world projects** as a student is a **rare and lucky experience**.  
This project has not only helped me grow technically but also taught me **time management, responsibility, and client communication**.
