# Shivakoti Temple Management System

This is a **real-world project** I am currently developing in **Laravel (PHP framework)**. The client specifically requested Laravel, which challenged me to learn and build in this framework while delivering the project.

## Project Overview

The application is designed for **temple management** with three distinct roles:

- **Super Admin:** Full control over all modules (manage admins, roles, permissions, events, devotees).  
- **Admin:** Manage devotees, puja bookings, events, and day-to-day operations.  
- **Devotee:** Register, log in, book pujas/darshan, and access temple-related services.  

Each role has its own actions, permissions, and workflows, making the project complex and interesting.

## My Journey

- Learned **Laravel** from scratch while developing the project.  
- Gained exposure to **role-based access control**, **database design**, and **complex workflow handling**.  
- Managed tight timelines while ensuring a solution that meets client expectations.  

## Current Responsibilities

- Learning Laravel fundamentals and applying them directly.  
- Implementing **multi-role authentication and authorization**.  
- Designing intuitive UIs for devotees and admins.  
- Ensuring scalability and maintainability for real-world use.  

## Parallel Commitments

Alongside Shivakoti, I am:  

- Serving as **Group Representative (GR)** of my class.  
- Participating in **MSME Hackathon** and **Amaravati Quantum Valley Hackathon (AQVH)**.  
- Working on a **CSP project** under the guidance of the JNTUA Principal, expected to evolve into a commercial application.  
- Preparing for **semester exams**.  

## Reflection

Getting opportunities to work on **real-world projects as a student** is rare and valuable.  
This project has enhanced my **technical skills**, **time management**, **responsibility**, and **client communication** abilities.
